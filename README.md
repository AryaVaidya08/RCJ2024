# How To Use This Repo

## DO NOT CHANGE! (MAKE ANOTHER .md IF YOU WANT TO)

Since ereveryone is doing a different thing programming wise usually, **make your own branch and create a different folder for all of your stuff to go under** so it makes merging different branches a peice of cake.

For example: 

0. The main branch

Maze2024 (Branch --> Main)\n
  -- README.md

1. Arya is doing vision:

Maze2024 (Branch -->  Vision)
  -- README.md
  -- Vision (folder)
      -- All the random stuff


2. Now Arav wants to do navigation:

Maze2024 (Branch -- Navigation)
  -- README.md
  -- Nav (folder)
     -- All the random stuff

3. Now when we merge to main:

Maze2024 (Branch --> Main)
  -- README.md
  -- Nav (folder)
    -- ...
  -- Vision (folder)
    -- ...

YAYAYYA No Merge Conflicts!
