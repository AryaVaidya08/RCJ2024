# How To Use This Repo

## DO NOT CHANGE! (MAKE ANOTHER .md IF YOU WANT TO)

Since ereveryone is doing a different thing programming wise usually, **make your own branch and create a different folder for all of your stuff to go under** so it makes merging different branches a peice of cake.

For example: 

### 0) The main branch

Maze2024 (Branch --> Main)\
&nbsp;&nbsp;-- README.md

### 1) Arya is doing vision:

Maze2024 (Branch -->  Vision)\
&nbsp;&nbsp;-- README.md\
&nbsp;&nbsp;-- Vision (folder)\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- All the random stuff

### 2) Now Arav wants to do navigation:

Maze2024 (Branch -- Navigation)\
&nbsp;&nbsp;-- README.md\
&nbsp;&nbsp;-- Nav (folder)\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- All the random stuff

### 3) Now when we merge to main:

Maze2024 (Branch --> Main)\
&nbsp;&nbsp;-- README.md\
&nbsp;&nbsp;-- Nav (folder)\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- ...\
&nbsp;&nbsp;-- Vision (folder)\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- ...

YAYAYYA No Merge Conflicts!
